**Overview of the Project**
This Java code is for a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

**Initialization**
The code imports the java.util.Scanner class, which is used to get input from the user.
A Scanner object sc is created to read input from the user.
Three double variables num1, num2, and sol are declared to store the two input numbers and the result of the operation, respectively.
A char variable operator is declared to store the operator entered by the user.

**Getting User Input**
The code prompts the user to enter two numbers using System.out.println.
The user's input is read using sc.nextDouble() and stored in num1 and num2.
The code then prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) using System.out.println.
The user's input is read using sc.next().charAt(0) and stored in operator.

**Performing the Operation**
The code uses a switch statement to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the operator entered by the user.
The result of the operation is stored in sol.

**Displaying the Result**
The code displays the result of the operation using System.out.println.
The output includes the two input numbers, the operator, and the result of the operation.
